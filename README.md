WIKICAUSE
=========
Plot the causality of events past, present and future.


**Wikicause** is a Free Open Source platform built to help visualize the effects caused by events. 

For example: 

- An apple falls from a tree
- Said apple hits Newton on the head
- Newton discovers the law of gravity
- Newton’s laws of gravity and motion are published
- […]
- The Wright brothers take first flight
- […]
- Maglev trains are invented

From scientific break throughs to devastating wars, Wikicause shows how one event may seem small at that point but has an effect even today.
